# pytest

First time using python, first time using github and first time learning network.

I dropped the course last week. I am here to see what the exam is like to help me figure out how to prepare for it if I take it next year.

Caeser cypher works before I try to throw in the network stuff. (I know ceaser cypher function is easy for computer science people)

I don't know how to submit so I added professor as a collabrator. 

Thank you for your time.
